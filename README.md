# AguilarFMadLibsEndpoint

// Opening the file AguilarFMadLibsEndpoint in vs code, turn on the debug feture and let it run. Once it has finished running the
// localhost page will show up and say it can't be found. Return to the debug console in vs sharp and copy + paste the http url ( example: http://localhost:5250 ).
// Open up Postman in your web browser and create a new http request. Paste the http into the request. You type in / and then the name of the controller
// including what goes in after the route in parenthesis. With another dash you input the values you wish for {myName}, {friendName}, {favPlace}, {adjective}, {superHero1},
// {superHero2}, {evilVillain}, {power1}, {power2}, and {amusementPark}. Enter send and the url should output into postman the entire mad lib including all of the users
// inputs for the story!

// Peer Reviewed By: Christopher Prado, this code is adaquetly organized and outputs a quite creative story. Try at your own risk but I surely reccomend >:)
